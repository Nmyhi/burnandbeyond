### Strategic Trade offs

| Opportunity/Problem | Importance | Viability/Feasability |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Create an online presence | 5 | 5 |
| Display the range of services and products on the site | 5 | 3 |
| Increase social media interaction | 3 | 4 |
| Provide opportunity to get in touch | 5 | 3 |
| Showcase gallery images | 3 | 5 |
| Total | 21 | Avg 20 |

Above I have listed documented some trade-offs and I will explain the reasoning behind them.

- Online presence
  - This is mandatory and should be achievable given that I am a Front-End Web Developer(the course upto now has given everything I need to achieve this).

- Display the range of services and products on the site
  - Not as important as an online presence, but most definitely still up there. I feel it is also feasible given my skillset, however this company is still quite small in size
   therefore there is not too many things to showcase.

- Social media interaction
  - Again, this is well within my skillset as this could be something as simple as a CTA or footer icons with links to social media.

- Provide opportunity to get in touch
  - In order to get in touch I can provide a company email and a contact form with all the details of the company, however being a front-end developer I feel like this problem is not fully solved yet, because of the lack of back-end knowledge. (the contact form is not fully functioning.)

- Showcase gallery images
  - This is a fully achiveable goal through different photoes I have collected throughtout the company's lifetime.
  
## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted to use a colour scheme that wasn't going to distract too much from the text but also make the website pop, and look fun. I felt like the approach is to use various shades of grey with few vibrant colours like a shade of blue, white and silver.

### Typography

I decided that I didn't want to overcomplicate the typography, and settled on Roboto and Oxygen with a fallback font of Sans-serif. 

Font weights for Roboto are regular(300) and medium(500) and bold. Regular is used for the text on the pages and medium, bold are used for headings.

### Imagery

Being a local lasercutting company I decided to use as many own images as possible, however I used few stock and AI generated photos as well.

- External sources:

[Unsplash](https://unplash.com "Stock photo site") <br>
[Dall-e-2](https://openai.com/product/dall-e-2 "Photo generator site")

- I have used a free photo editor for formatting my own pictures.

[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org "free photo manipulator software")

- I have used a free open source video editor to transform the index page hero video.
