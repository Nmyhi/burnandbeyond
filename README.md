Above I have listed documented some trade-offs and I will explain the reasoning behind them.

- Online presence
  - This is mandatory and should be achievable given that I am a Front-End Web Developer(the course upto now has given everything I need to achieve this).

- Display the range of services and products on the site
  - Not as important as an online presence, but most definitely still up there. I feel it is also feasible given my skillset, however this company is still quite small in size
   therefore there is not too many things to showcase.

- Social media interaction
  - Again, this is well within my skillset as this could be something as simple as a CTA or footer icons with links to social media.

- Provide opportunity to get in touch
  - In order to get in touch I can provide a company email and a contact form with all the details of the company, however being a front-end developer I feel like this problem is not fully solved yet, because of the lack of back-end knowledge. (the contact form is not fully functioning.)

- Showcase gallery images
  - This is a fully achiveable goal through different photoes I have collected throughtout the company's lifetime.
